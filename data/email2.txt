ðŸ“§ 4. Client Request for AI Dashboard Customization

Subject: Customization Request for AI Analytics Dashboard
To: Lisa Monroe (Data Analytics Manager, FinTech Solutions)
From: Alex Rogers (Product Manager, AI Insights Ltd.)

Dear Lisa,

I hope youâ€™re doing well. Weâ€™ve been using your AI-powered analytics dashboard for the past few months, and overall, we are quite satisfied with its capabilities. However, we have a few specific requirements that would greatly enhance our workflow.

Customization Requests:
	1.	Custom Report Generation: We need a feature that allows us to generate reports with custom date ranges and specific KPI selection.
	2.	Real-Time Data Sync: Currently, the dashboard updates data every 6 hours, but we require real-time data syncing for our high-frequency trading operations.
	3.	User Access Control: We want the ability to create role-based access permissions, ensuring that different teams only see relevant data.
	4.	Dark Mode UI Option: Many of our analysts work long hours, and a dark mode theme would be beneficial for reducing eye strain.

Can you let us know if these changes can be implemented? If so, we would appreciate an estimate on costs and development timelines.

Looking forward to your response!

Best,
Alex Rogers
